# How Long to Watch...
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,bootstrap,js)](https://skillicons.dev)

Do you have a slight obsession with audiovisual media? Have you ever wondered how long it would take you to binge watch that show that has been on your watchlist for years? Or maybe see how many episodes you would need to watch per day to catch up on that show everyone’s been talking about?

You’ve come to the right place then! 

This is the first major project of my own combining Bootstrap and REST API.

You can check out the live demo by clicking [here](https://how-long-to-watch.netlify.app/).

## Preview

## Features

  * 📺 Calculate the end date of your TV Show marathon based on the number of episodes you want to watch per day
  * 🕐 Or maybe calculate it on the number of minutes
  * 📅 If you’re trying to finish it by a certain date, you can also check how much you need to watch per day to get there
